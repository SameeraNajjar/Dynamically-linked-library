# Dynamically-linked-library
Desiging and implementing A dynamically linked library.

Design and implement a program that utilizes a set of functions that are dynamically linked. You need to show that multiple programs utilize the same set of dynamically linked functions. Your library should be loaded dynamically at run time. Use C/C++ language for implementation.

The Library contain the following functions:
1. sort (int * a , const int size)
2. readinfo (int *a, const int size);
3. display (int *a, const int size);
4. computeAvg (int *a, const int size);
